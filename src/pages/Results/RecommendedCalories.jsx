          Your body burns calories just to stay alive â€” thatâ€™s your BMR. Add in
          movement, and you burn even more. Eat less than you burn? You lose
          weight. Eat more? You store it. Simple math, but the type of calories
          still makes or breaks your results.

        <Paragraph.sm>
          Most people eat low-quality calories that spike cravings, crash
          energy, and cause fat to stick â€” even if theyâ€™re technically under
          their daily limit.
