          This is your potential, what your body could lose if itâ€™s in
          fat-burning mode. But that depends on getting your metabolism working
          with you, not against you.
        </Paragraph.sm>
        <Paragraph.sm>
          Low energy, stubborn cravings, and slow progress usually mean your
          body is still burning sugar instead of fat â€” and that keeps weight
          loss stuck.

          With your numbers, results could show up even faster than expected,
          but only if your metabolism is dialed in and youâ€™re burning fat, not
          sugar.
